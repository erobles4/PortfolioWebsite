			Currently, I am a Student at Northeastern Illinois University and working on getting a degree in computer science.
			In high school I was introduced to Programming, and ever since I have tried to learn as much as I can about coding. 
			At first, I wanted to learn coding to create video games. When, I was fourteen years old I took a class in Video Game Development.
			Video game development still interesting to me, now I enjoy making new programs and seeing what works and what doesn't.
			One of my favorite things to do is working with computers, from coding programs to building computers. 
			I've built the computers I use at home, and the computers that my family members and friends uses. 
			Beyond computers, I enjoy listening to music especially rap and hip-hop. 
			One of my future goals is to travel as much as I can of the world, currently I plan to travel to Japan and Spain with some friends.
